# Social Network API MongoDB Back End

## Description

This project utilizes the NoSQL database of MongoDB in order to create a back end for a Social Network Application. Through the use of mongoose, models and controllers for said models were created in order to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods on the data. Within this project, a subdocument was used to create a relationship within one of the models. This use of a subdocument is distinctly different compared to how a similar thing would be achieved using SQL. 

Below is the walkthrough video that will show the setup for the models, how to invoke the application, and a rundown of all the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE routes being achieved.
